# Ultrasonic Radar Alert System  
This project implements an **Ultrasonic Radar Alert System** with the following features:  
- 180Â° object detection using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.  
- Real-time radar interface visualization.  
- Automatic gate locking based on object proximity.  
- Visual (LEDs) and auditory (buzzer) alerts.  

## Features  
- **Hardware:** Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor, LEDs, Buzzer.  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Tinkercad for simulation.  

## Installation and Usage  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the code in the Arduino IDE.  
3. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
